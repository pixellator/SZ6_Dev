Let's continue with the development of the WSZ6-portal.
Now that we have reasonable support for installing games
and playing them, let's flesh out the researcher's interface.

Please refer back to the WSZ6-portal-dev-plan.md (call it
DEV_PLAN), and the
recent report of an audit of the system as it exists:
Claudes_Audit_of_WSZ6_portal_Feb_20_2026.md
You can see that we're very roughly about half way through
the plan.  Also, there is technical debt in what has been
accomplished, we are leaving some of that for later, in order
to be able to get a clearer overview of what the entire
system will be like.

The researcher's interface is described, in DEV_PLAN,
in section ### 8.6 Research Data Access Workflow.
We need a plan to develop this functionality.

Note: in addition to log files, some games may produce
artifacts such as separate text documents.  An open question
is whether these should be part of the log files or separate
files pointed to by the log files.  If the latter, then there
is a question of where they are stored (perhaps together with
their log files in a folder of session data).  If the former,
then there is a question of whether the entire document text
is copied repeatedly in the logs whenever small edits are done
or only the deltas are in the log files, but with a full
version of the resulting doc coming at the end of the log file.
When a researcher views a game-playthrough log file, they should
have the option of seeing any document-like text in an appropriate
view pane.

Ideally, a researcher would have a means to "annotate" a game-session
list and a log file, but these annotations should be separate from
the Game Data Base and belong to the researcher, perhaps in a
relational DB record that references the game, session, frame in
the log file, and gives the annotation string.

There should also be an easy way for a researcher to get a "handle"
on any particular game sessions in order to paste them into external
analytics tools that can then access the data via the portal's
API.

Please write your plan to develop this functionality in a file
called Researcher-panel-dev-plan.md.
